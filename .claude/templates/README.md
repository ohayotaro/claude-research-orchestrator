# `.claude/templates/`

Starter scripts that `/init-research` copies into the user's project on
initialization. Organized by **runtime language** so the orchestrator can
support more than just Python.

## Structure

```
.claude/templates/
  README.md           This file.
  python/             Recipes for Python projects (uv-managed, default).
    repro.py          → src/utils/repro.py   (reproducibility metadata helper)
    viz.py            → src/utils/viz.py     (matplotlib publication / presentation styling)
  r/                  (not yet shipped — placeholder)
    repro.R           → R/utils/repro.R
    viz.R             → R/utils/viz.R
  julia/              (not yet shipped — placeholder)
    repro.jl
    viz.jl
```

## How `/init-research` selects a recipe

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` Zone B → `runtime.language` (default: `python`).
2. Look for `.claude/templates/<language>/`.
3. Copy each file in that directory to its target path under the user's project (the mapping is documented per-recipe inside the file's docstring).
4. If `.claude/templates/<language>/` does not exist, fall back to `python/` and warn the user that no native recipes for `<language>` are shipped yet.

## Design principles for templates

- **Frameworks-of-the-language, not third-party stacks.** Python recipes use stdlib + matplotlib + numpy because those are in `pyproject.toml`. Avoid pulling in opinionated third-party stacks (Plotly, Polars, etc.) that the user may not want.
- **Generic fallback chains.** Don't pin OS-specific resources. Example: font families use `["DejaVu Serif", "Liberation Serif", ..., "serif"]` rather than hardcoding `Times New Roman` first.
- **Discipline checks, not aesthetic prescriptions.** Where the template enforces something, it should be a research-rigor concern (e.g. "figure has no title and no caption argument" → raise) rather than a style opinion.
- **Editable after copy.** Once copied, the file under `src/utils/` (or `R/utils/` etc.) belongs to the user's project. Project-specific edits live there. The template file under `.claude/templates/` stays generic.

## Adding a new language

1. Create `.claude/templates/<language>/`.
2. Provide at minimum:
   - A reproducibility helper that captures: seeds, env / package versions, git rev, started_at / finished_at, runtime version. Output `metadata.json` with the same schema as `python/repro.py` so the `reproducibility-check` hook can validate it.
   - A visualization helper that ships at least the Okabe-Ito 8-color palette and a `save_figure`-equivalent that writes both a vector format (PDF / SVG) and a raster preview.
3. Update `init-research` SKILL.md to mention the new language as a supported `runtime.language` value.
4. Open a PR with example output from a smoke run.

## Open question (intentional)

This directory does **not** ship templates for visualization stacks beyond matplotlib (no Plotly / Bokeh / Altair / etc.) and does not ship LaTeX paper templates. Those are deliberately left to project-level customization because they are venue / preference dependent. If a strong default emerges (e.g. a NeurIPS LaTeX template), it can be added under a separate `.claude/templates/latex/` tree.
