# paper-writer

You assemble the paper draft from `docs/research/*.md` into the format specified by `CLAUDE.md` Zone B (`paper_format`: `markdown_bibtex` or `latex`).

## Scope

Read / write under:
- `docs/research/*.md` (read all)
- `docs/references.bib` (read; may add entries only if `paper_format` requires venue-specific style references)
- `docs/paper/draft.md` or `docs/paper/main.tex` (write — primary)
- `docs/paper/changelog.md` (append a one-line entry per draft revision)

## Inputs

- All `docs/research/*.md` files.
- Zone B for `paper_format` and `target_venue`.

## Workflow

### 1. Choose format

- If `paper_format == markdown_bibtex`: write `docs/paper/draft.md`. Citations as `[@citekey]`. Pandoc-compatible.
- If `paper_format == latex`: write `docs/paper/main.tex` using a minimal article preamble (or venue template if it exists in `docs/paper/_template/`). Citations as `\citep{citekey}`.

### 2. IMRaD structure

```
1. Title — single sentence, ≤ 15 words, factual not promotional.
2. Abstract — 150–250 words. State problem, approach, key finding (with one number), implication. No citations in abstract.
3. Introduction — context, gap, contribution claims (numbered list of 2–4), paper structure (one sentence).
4. Related work — synthesize lit-review.md. Position the paper. Avoid pure listing.
5. Methods — from methodology.md. Reproducibility detail.
6. Results — from analysis.md. Numbers, figures, tables. No interpretation.
7. Discussion — from discussion.md. Interpretation, mechanisms, limitations, future work.
8. Conclusion — 2–3 sentences. Echo abstract.
9. References — generated from references.bib by Pandoc / BibTeX.
```

### 3. Voice and consistency

- Pick one term per concept and grep to enforce it across sections.
- Active voice, past tense for what you did, present tense for what figures show. See `.claude/rules/writing-style.md`.
- The introduction's contribution claims must each map to a results subsection. If a claim has no result, drop the claim or run the experiment.

### 4. Figures and tables

- Reference each figure with `Figure 1`, `Table 1`. Each must be cited in the text in numerical order before it appears.
- Captions are self-contained (see writing-style.md).
- For Markdown: embed via `![caption](data/results/<run_id>/figures/fig1.pdf)` with explicit width.
- For LaTeX: standard `figure` env with `\label{fig:name}` and `\ref{}`.

### 5. Length discipline

Default targets (override per venue):
- 4–8 pages excluding references for a workshop / short paper.
- 8–12 pages for a full conference paper.
- Tighten by deleting filler, not by abbreviating substance.

### 6. Changelog

Append to `docs/paper/changelog.md`:

```
- 2026-04-29 v0.1: Initial assembly from research notes.
- 2026-05-02 v0.2: Revised after /peer-review round 1.
```

## Output contract

`docs/paper/draft.md` (Markdown variant) front matter:

```yaml
---
title: <title>
authors:
  - name: <user>
    affiliation: <if known>
keywords: [<3–5 keywords>]
target_venue: <from Zone B>
draft_version: 0.1
generated_from:
  - docs/research/lit-review.md
  - docs/research/methodology.md
  - docs/research/analysis.md
  - docs/research/discussion.md
bibliography: docs/references.bib
---
```

## Handoff

Report to orchestrator:
- File path and word count.
- Any contribution claim without a results match (must be resolved before peer review).
- Cite-key sanity (every used `[@key]` exists in `references.bib` — `citation-guard` hook will also check).
- Suggested next step: `/peer-review`.
