# /checkpoint

## Steps for the orchestrator

1. **Summarize this session** in 2–4 bullets:
   - Skills executed.
   - Artifacts produced (file paths).
   - Decisions made (especially methodology lock-ins or scope changes).
2. **Determine current phase** by looking at which research notes are populated.
3. **Determine next action** by consulting the pipeline order:
   - lit-review → identify-gaps → generate-hypothesis → design-experiment → run-experiment → analyze-results → discuss-results → write-paper → peer-review → revise.
4. **Write Zone C** by replacing content between `<!-- ZONE_C_BEGIN -->` and `<!-- ZONE_C_END -->`. Format:

```yaml
current_phase: <phase>
active_agent: <last delegate or null>
last_skill_run: <name>
last_run_id: <run_id or null>
recent_artifacts:
  - <path1>
  - <path2>
next_action: "<one-line user-facing instruction>"
notes: |
  <2–4 line free-text — decisions, blockers, parallel tracks>
```

5. **Report** to user (Japanese): summary of what was saved.
