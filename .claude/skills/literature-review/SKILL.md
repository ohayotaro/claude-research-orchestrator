# /literature-review

Delegates to the `literature-reviewer` agent. The orchestrator's job is to (a) confirm Zone B has an RQ, (b) launch the agent with clear scope, (c) integrate its handoff.

## Steps for the orchestrator

1. **Pre-flight.** Check `CLAUDE.md` Zone B has `research_question` set and non-empty. If not, suggest `/init-research`.
2. **Check Gemini availability.** Read `.claude/logs/setup-status.json`. If `gemini_available: false`, warn the user that retrieval coverage will be reduced and ask whether to proceed with the Claude `WebFetch` fallback.
3. **Launch agent** (`literature-reviewer`) with:
   - The RQ and sub-questions.
   - Any seed citations the user names.
   - Target: 30–60 papers reviewed, top 10–20 read in depth.
4. **Receive handoff** (number of papers, themes, candidate gaps, retrieval failures).
5. **Update Zone C** of `CLAUDE.md`: `current_phase: literature`, `last_skill_run: literature-review`, `next_action: "Run /identify-gaps"`.
6. **Report to user** (Japanese): theme list, retrieval coverage, suggested next step.

## Common variants

- **Targeted update**: user names a specific subtopic. Pass that as the search scope; agent appends rather than rewrites.
- **Sanity check on a single paper**: skip this skill; use `gemini-explore` directly.
