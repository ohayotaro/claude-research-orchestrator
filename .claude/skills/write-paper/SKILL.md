# /write-paper

## Steps for the orchestrator

1. **Pre-flight.** All four research notes (`lit-review.md`, `methodology.md`, `analysis.md`, `discussion.md`) exist and are non-trivial.
2. **Launch** `paper-writer`. The agent reads Zone B for `paper_format` and assembles accordingly.
3. **Citation sanity check.** The `citation-guard` hook runs on every Write/Edit; if it warns, the agent must fix before declaring done.
4. **Contribution-claim check.** Every contribution claim in the introduction maps to a results subsection. Ask `paper-writer` to flag any unmatched claim.
5. **Word count vs target.** If the venue has a length limit, compare against `target_venue`. If over by > 10%, ask the writer to tighten.
6. **Update changelog.** Verify the writer appended to `docs/paper/changelog.md`.
7. **Update Zone C**: `current_phase: writing`, `next_action: "Run /peer-review"`.
