# /revise

## Steps for the orchestrator

1. **Locate the latest review** (`review-<n>.md`).
2. **Launch** `paper-writer` in revise mode. For each review point, the agent:
   - Either applies a change (records `file:line` in the rebuttal scaffold's "Change made" column),
   - Or declines (records "no change — reason").
   - Blockers and majors **must** be addressed (applied or explicitly justified for non-application). Minors and nits may be deferred.
3. **Re-run citation-guard logic mentally** — the hook will catch any new uncited claims when the file is written.
4. **If the revision touches numbers or methodology**, this is a deviation: must be recorded under "Deviations" in `methodology.md` per the design-experiment skill's rule.
5. **Append** to `changelog.md`: `- <date> v<x.y>: addressed review-<n>.md (B:<count>, M:<count>, m:<count>, n:<count>)`.
6. **Recommend re-review** if any blocker remained unfixed, or if the change was substantial (> 25% of major comments addressed).
7. **Update Zone C**: `current_phase: revision`.
